## Overview

A full **ML pipeline** to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health data.  

Pipeline stages:
✅ Data cleaning & feature engineering  
✅ Model training & hyperparameter tuning  
✅ Model evaluation  
✅ Automated reporting  

---

## Business Impact

**Diabetes Prediction** is key for:
- Early intervention & prevention in healthcare  
- Personalized treatment plans  
- Insurance risk modeling  
- Public health research  

The pipeline is designed to be cloud-deployable and scalable for healthcare applications.
